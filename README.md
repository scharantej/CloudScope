## Flask Application Design

### Objective
The goal is to develop a Flask application that offers a dashboard for monitoring a multi-layered app deployed in GCP. This dashboard will aggregate data from various resources like VMs, GKE Workloads, and CloudSQL instances. The purpose is to gain insights into the overall health and performance of the application.

### HTML Files

#### `index.html`

- This will serve as the main interface for the dashboard.
- It will contain the layout and structure of the dashboard.
- It will include sections for displaying metrics, graphs, and other relevant information.

#### `vms.html`

- This file will be responsible for displaying metrics related to VMs.
- It will present information such as CPU utilization, memory usage, network traffic, and disk I/O.

#### `gke_workloads.html`

- This file will focus on metrics related to GKE Workloads.
- It will display data such as container resource utilization, pod status, and workload health.

#### `cloudsql_instances.html`

- This file will present metrics specific to CloudSQL instances.
- It will include information on database connection counts, query execution times, and storage usage.

### Routes

#### `/`

- This route will serve the main dashboard (`index.html`).
- It will provide an overview of the entire deployment, including metrics from VMs, GKE Workloads, and CloudSQL instances.

#### `/vms`

- This route will serve the `vms.html` page.
- It will display detailed metrics for each VM in the deployment.

#### `/gke_workloads`

- This route will serve the `gke_workloads.html` page.
- It will display metrics for each GKE Workload, including cluster information and workload health.

#### `/cloudsql_instances`

- This route will serve the `cloudsql_instances.html` page.
- It will display metrics for each CloudSQL instance, such as connection counts and query execution times.

### Additional Considerations

- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to authorized users.
- Integrate with a monitoring tool such as Prometheus or Grafana to collect and visualize metrics.
- Use Flask's templating engine to dynamically generate HTML pages based on data fetched from the monitoring tool.
- Implement responsive design to ensure the dashboard works well on different devices and screen sizes.

This design provides a solid foundation for building a Flask application that serves as a comprehensive monitoring dashboard for a multi-layered app deployed in GCP. It covers various aspects of the deployment and enables users to monitor the health and performance of their application effectively.
